    "\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the global mean,  $U_u$ a user embedding and $I_i$ an item embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEPS:\n",
    " To implement such model in pytorch, we need to do multiple things:\n",
    " \n",
    " - (1) model definition\n",
    " - (2) loss function\n",
    " - (3) evaluation\n",
    " - (4) training/eval loop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### (1) Model definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A model class typically extends `nn.Module`, the Neural network module. It is a convenient way of encapsulating parameters, with helpers for moving them to GPU, exporting, loading, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "One should define two functions: `__init__` and `forward`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__init__` is used to initialize the model parameters\n",
    "- `forward` is the net transformation from input to output. In fact, when doing `moduleClass(input)` you call this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (a) Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model has different weigths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the user profiles (also called user embeddings) $U$\n",
    "- the item profiles (also called user embeddings) $I$\n",
    "- the mean bias $\\mu$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (b) input to output operation\n",
    "Technically, the prediction as defined earlier can be seen as just a dot product between two embeddings $U_u$ and $I_i$ plus the mean rating:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `torch.sum(embed_u*embed_i,1) + self.mean` is equivalent to $r_{ui} = \\mu + U_u.I_i $ \n",
    "- the `.squeeze(1)` operation is a shape operation to remove the dimension 1 (indexing starts at 0) akin to reshaping the matrix from `(batch_size,1,latent_size)` to `(batch_size,latent_size)`\n",
    "- for reference, the inverse operation is `.unsqueeze()`\n",
    "- we return weights to regularize them\n",
