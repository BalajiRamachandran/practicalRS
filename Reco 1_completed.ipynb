    "\n",
    "On the internet, people rate items (or simply click on them, showing preference). All these ratings can be seen as a matrix coding for all ratings of size (n_user,n_item).It's worth noting that this matrix is highly sparse: No one rates everything, people only rate a subset of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation (more specifically **collaborative filtering**) goal can be seen as predicting how someone will rate one item. This is akin to filling this matrix, by predicting all missing ratings. The most used algorithms for this task are matrix factorization ones: they take advantage from the fact that a matrix can be decomposed into two sub-matrices: one coding for the users and one coding for the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why predicting ratings and not directly items:\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoritically, the goal of a recommender system is to cherry pick interesting items for one user within a huge collection. Rating prediction is a surrogate problem of item prediction. To get what item to recommend you can, for exemple, simply sort best rated items. It has been shown that improving rating prediction actually improve item prediction.\n",
